Hi, I'm Jhon.

I am a Data Science student at Bogot√°, Colombia. I am passionate about the world of development and music.

In the field of development, I am interested in learning about new technologies and applying them to solve real-world problems. I have experience programming in Python, JavaScript, and C++. I am also familiarizing myself with technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

In the field of music, i like techno and just electronic music in general.

I consider myself to be a creative and perseverant person. I am always looking for new challenges and learning new things.
